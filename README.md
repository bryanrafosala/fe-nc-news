# NC NEWS

[**NC NEWS**](https://nc-news-front-end99.netlify.app) is a platform for social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion, similar to Reddit. Users can share articles, comment on posts, and vote articles up or down.

The project is built using **React**, styled with **Vanilla CSS**, and hosted on **Netlify**: [https://nc-news-front-end99.netlify.app](https://nc-news-front-end99.netlify.app/).

Details of the back-end can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/bryanrafosala/be-nc-news).

## Development Process

Before development, I created a wireframe and component tree to plan out the structure of the app. I also identified the API endpoints needed for each component, ensuring efficient state management and data passing via props.
